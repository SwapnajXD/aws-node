## Project Structure

```

├── docker-compose.yml
├── client/      # React + Vite frontend (served via Nginx)
└── server/      # Express API + PostgreSQL + Redis
```

---

# Prerequisites

- Docker  
- Docker Compose  
- ngrok (optional — required only for public links)

Download ngrok:

https://ngrok.com/download

# Running Locally (Development Mode)

Generates local links like:

```
http://localhost:8080/<slug>
```

## 1. Start the Application

From the project root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## 2. Access Services

| Service   | URL                    |
|------------|-----------------------|
| Frontend   | http://localhost:8080 |
| API        | http://localhost:5000 |

## 3. Test the Application

1. Open `http://localhost:8080`
2. Paste a long URL
3. Generate a short link
4. Click the link to verify redirect functionality

---

# Running with ngrok (Public Shareable Links)

This enables public URLs like:

```
https://your-domain.ngrok-free.dev/r/<slug>
```

Only the API (port 5000) needs to be exposed via ngrok.

---

## Step 1 — Start Docker

```bash
docker compose up
```

---

## Step 2 — Start ngrok (Expose Backend Only)

In a new terminal:

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

You will receive a public HTTPS URL such as:

```
https://example-subdomain.ngrok-free.dev
```

Note: On the free plan, this domain changes every time ngrok restarts.

---

## Step 3 — Update Frontend Build Variables

Open `docker-compose.yml` and update:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build:
      args:
        VITE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: "https://<your-ngrok-domain>/r"
        VITE_API_URL: "https://<your-ngrok-domain>"
```

Example:

```yaml
VITE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: "https://example-subdomain.ngrok-free.dev/r"
VITE_API_URL: "https://example-subdomain.ngrok-free.dev"
```

---

## Step 4 — Rebuild Frontend Only

The frontend must be rebuilt when environment variables change.

```bash
docker compose build web
docker compose up
```

Generated links will now be publicly accessible:

```
https://example-subdomain.ngrok-free.dev/r/my-link-Ab12Cd
```

The backend does not require rebuilding.

---

# When ngrok Domain Changes

Each time ngrok restarts:

1. Copy the new domain  
2. Update in `docker-compose.yml`:
   - `VITE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
   - `VITE_API_URL`
3. Rebuild frontend:

```bash
docker compose build web
docker compose up
```

---

# API Endpoints

## POST `/api/shorten`

Creates a new short URL.

Request:

```json
{
  "longUrl": "https://example.com",
  "phrase": "my-link"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "slug": "my-link-Ab12Cd"
}
```

---

## GET `/api/resolve/:slug`

Returns the original long URL without redirecting.

---

## GET `/r/:slug`

Public redirect endpoint used for shareable links.

Example:

```
https://<ngrok-domain>/r/my-link-Ab12Cd
```

Redirects to the stored long URL.

# Technology Stack

| Layer      | Technology            |
|------------|-----------------------|
| Frontend   | React + Vite + Nginx  |
| Backend    | Node.js + Express     |
| Database   | PostgreSQL            |
| Cache      | Redis                 |
| DevOps     | Docker Compose        |
| Public URL | ngrok (optional)      |

---

# Important Notes

- The frontend must be rebuilt if `VITE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` changes.
- The API does not require rebuilding when ngrok changes.
- Public redirect path format:

```
/r/<slug>
```

---

# Optional Cleanup

If legacy root files exist:

```bash
rm -f server.js Dockerfile package.json package-lock.json
```

Keep the project structure clean:

```
client/
server/
```

---

# Ready for Use

This URL shortener supports:

- Local development
- Public shareable links
- Redis-powered performance
- Fully containerized deployment
- Clean and production-ready structure
